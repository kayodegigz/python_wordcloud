# WORDCLOUD PROJECT THAT ALLOWS YOU INSERT A TEXT FILE
# THE FUNCTION RUNS THE TEXT FILE THROUGH SOME CHECKS LIKE CHECKING FOR "FILLER WORDS", FOR EXAMPLE THE, IS, NOT ETC.
# THE FUNCTION ALSO CHECKS AND REMOVES PUNCTUATION MARKS FROM THE STRING
# THEN THE FUNCTION RETURNS A WORDCLOUD IMAGE OF ALL THE WORDS IN THE TEXT FILE IN VARYING SIZES DEPENDING ON THE FREQUENCY OF OCCURRENCE IN THE TEXT FILE

# THIS IS A SMALL PROJECT BY KAYODE OGUNRINDE
